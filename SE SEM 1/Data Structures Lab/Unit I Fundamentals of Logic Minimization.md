# **Unit I: Fundamentals of Logic Minimization:**


- **Logic Design Minimization:** Techniques for reducing the complexity of Boolean expressions (fewer gates)
- **K-Map Method:** Graphical method for simplifying Boolean functions with up to four variables
    - Minimization rules for grouping terms on a K-map
    - Identifying prime implicants and essential prime implicants
    - Representing SOP (Sum-Of-Products) and POS (Product-Of-Sums) forms on K-maps
- **Quine-McClusky Method (Optional):** Tabular method for simplifying Boolean functions with any number of variables (more complex than K-map for smaller functions)

**Exemplar/Case Studies:**

- **Digital Locks using Logic Gates:** Design a simple combination lock circuit using AND, OR, and NOT gates.
- **Mapping of Course Outcomes for Unit I (CO1):** Link learning objectives to specific logic minimization concepts covered.
