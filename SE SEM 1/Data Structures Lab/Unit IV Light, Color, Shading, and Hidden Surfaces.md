### **1. Explain the Back-face Removal Algorithm with an example. [6 Marks]**

#### Answer:

**Definition** (1 Mark):

- Back-face removal is a hidden surface detection technique used to determine which polygons of an object are not visible from a given viewpoint.

**Steps** (3 Marks):

1. Calculate the surface normal vector NNN of the polygon.
2. Determine the viewing direction VVV (usually along the Z-axis for standard views).
3. Compute the dot product $N⋅VN \cdot VN⋅V$ :
    - If $N⋅V>0N \cdot V > 0N⋅V>0$ , the polygon is a back-face and not visible.
    - If $N⋅V≤0N \cdot V \leq 0N⋅V≤0$ , the polygon is visible.

**Example** (2 Marks):

- Consider a cube with one face normal pointing inward $(N=(0,0,−1)N = (0, 0, -1)N=(0,0,−1))$ and the viewing direction V=(0,0,1)V = (0, 0, 1)V=(0,0,1). Since $N⋅V<0N \cdot V < 0N⋅V<0$, this face is a back-face and removed from the rendering process.

- Formula: $Ia=ka⋅II_a = k_a \cdot IIa​=ka​⋅I$ (where kak_aka​ is ambient reflectivity, III is intensity).

- Formula: $Id=kd⋅I⋅(LN)I_d = k_d \cdot I \cdot (\vec{L} \cdot \vec{N})Id​=kd​I(L)$ 





## **5. Explain Warnock's Algorithm [7 marks]

#### Answer:

##### Warnock's algorithm 
Warnock's algorithm is a hidden surface algorithm that solves the problem of rendering complex images in computer graphics. It was invented by John Warnock and uses a divide and conquer strategy to recursively subdivide a scene until it can be easily computed: 

Subdivision: The algorithm subdivides the area into four equal parts at each iteration. 
Comparison: Each polygon is compared to each area and placed into one of four bins: disjoint, intersecting, surrounding, or contained. 
Rendering: If the view is easy to calculate, it is rendered. If not, it is split into smaller parts and the algorithm recurses. 

**Warnock's Algorithm:**

1. **Start with a blank screen.**
2. **Sort the shapes.**
3. **Remove shapes that are too far or too close.**
4. **Figure out how the shapes overlap.**
5. **Decide what to draw:**
    - **If shapes don't overlap:** Fill the area with the background color.
    - **If one shape is inside another:** Fill the area with the background color and part of the inner shape.
    - **If one shape surrounds another:** Fill the area with the color of the surrounding shape.
    - **If shapes overlap:** Choose the closest shape and fill the area with its color.
    - **If nothing works:** Split the area and start again.

The algorithm's runtime is O(np), where p is the number of pixels in the viewport and n is the number of polygons. 
Warnock's algorithm is often used to create 3D configurers.

#### **Illumination Models**

**Q3. What is ambient light? How is it represented mathematically in illumination models? [5 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Ambient Light**:  
    Ambient light is the uniform, scattered light that exists in a scene. It simulates the indirect light that does not come from any particular direction and is present in all parts of the scene.
- **Mathematical Representation**:  
    The intensity of ambient light IaI_a is modeled as: Ia=ka⋅II_a = k_a \cdot I where:
    - IaI_a is the ambient light intensity.
    - kak_a is the ambient reflection coefficient (material property).
    - II is the total light intensity.

---

**Q4. Explain the Phong illumination model and its components. [6 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Phong Illumination Model**:  
    The Phong model simulates realistic lighting by combining three types of reflections:
    1. **Ambient Reflection**: Light that is scattered throughout the scene, representing indirect lighting.
    2. **Diffuse Reflection**: Light that is scattered in all directions, depending on the angle of the surface relative to the light source.
    3. **Specular Reflection**: Light that reflects off a surface in a specific direction, creating shiny highlights.
- **Phong Equation**: I=Ia+Id+IsI = I_a + I_d + I_s where:
    - IaI_a is ambient light,
    - Id=kd⋅I⋅(L⃗⋅N⃗)I_d = k_d \cdot I \cdot (\vec{L} \cdot \vec{N}) is diffuse reflection,
    - Is=ks⋅I⋅(R⃗⋅V⃗)nI_s = k_s \cdot I \cdot (\vec{R} \cdot \vec{V})^n is specular reflection.

---

#### **Shading Algorithms**

**Q5. What is the difference between Halftone and Gouraud shading? [5 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Halftone Shading**:  
    It simulates continuous tones by varying the density and size of dots, mainly used in printing. The image is represented as a set of dots, and the perception of smoothness comes from the varying dot sizes and their distribution.
    
- **Gouraud Shading**:  
    In Gouraud shading, colors are calculated at the vertices of a polygon, and these values are then interpolated across the surface of the polygon. This technique smooths the color transitions across polygons but may not accurately simulate specular highlights.
    

---

**Q6. Compare Gouraud shading and Phong shading in terms of computational complexity and realism. [6 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

|**Aspect**|**Gouraud Shading**|**Phong Shading**|
|---|---|---|
|**Computation**|Faster, computed at vertices|Slower, computed at each pixel|
|**Realism**|Less realistic, can miss specular highlights|More realistic, accurate highlights|
|**Application**|Real-time rendering in gaming|High-quality rendering in animations and movies|

- **Gouraud Shading** is faster because it only calculates lighting at the vertices and interpolates the color, while **Phong Shading** calculates lighting at every pixel, resulting in higher quality but at a higher computational cost.

---

#### **Hidden Surfaces**

**Q7. What is the purpose of hidden surface removal in rendering? [5 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Hidden Surface Removal**:  
    This technique is used in 3D computer graphics to determine which surfaces and parts of surfaces should be visible in a scene and which ones are occluded by other objects. It ensures that only visible parts of an object are rendered, improving performance and accuracy in 3D rendering.

---

**Q8. Explain the Z-buffer algorithm with an example. [6 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Z-buffer Algorithm**:  
    The Z-buffer (or depth-buffer) algorithm is used to keep track of the depth of each pixel in the rendered scene. For each pixel, the algorithm stores the distance from the camera (depth value). When rendering an object, it compares the depth of the new pixel with the current pixel’s depth. If the new pixel is closer, it updates the pixel color and depth.
    
    **Example**:  
    For two objects, a closer one will be rendered over the farther one. The Z-buffer keeps track of their depths to determine which object’s pixel is visible.
    

---

**Q9. Compare Depth Sorting (Painter’s Algorithm) and Warnock’s Algorithm. [6 Marks]**  
**Answer:**

- **Depth Sorting (Painter’s Algorithm)**:  
    This algorithm sorts the objects based on their distance from the viewer (depth). Objects that are farthest away are drawn first, and closer objects are drawn over them, like a painter layering paint.
    - **Limitations**: Does not handle overlapping objects well if they are not sorted correctly.
- **Warnock’s Algorithm**:  
    Warnock’s algorithm subdivides the viewing space into smaller regions recursively, simplifying the process of hidden surface removal. It is effective for complex scenes with numerous objects.
    - **Advantage**: Better at handling complex overlapping objects without requiring sorting.
