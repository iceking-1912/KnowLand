>>> Introduction to STL (Standard Template Library)
-----------------------------------------------------

STL is a powerful library of pre-defined generic data structures and algorithms in C++. It was introduced as part of the C++ Standard Library in 1998, making it easier for developers 
to write efficient and maintainable code without having to implement common data structures and algorithms themselves.

STL Components
--------------

* Containers: Store collections of elements such as arrays, linked lists, and maps. There are three types of containers in STL:
	+ Sequence container (e.g., vector, deque): Stores elements in a linear order, allowing easy access to the first or last element.
	+ Associative container (e.g., map, set): Stores pairs of key-value data in an organized manner, allowing efficient searching and sorting based on the key.
	+ Container adapters (e.g., stack, queue): Provide specialized versions of containers for specific purposes such as pushing and popping elements from one end or maintaining a sequence 
that only allows access to the front or back.

Containers- Sequence container and associative containers
----------------------------------------------------------
### Sequence container:
* vector: A dynamic array that can resize itself to accommodate more elements as needed. It supports random access, insertion, deletion, and efficient searching using algorithms such 
as linear search or binary search.
* deque: A double-ended queue that supports fast access to the front and back. It is particularly useful for implementing data structures that need to add and remove elements from both 
ends frequently.

### Associative containers:
* map: Stores a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique, allowing quick lookup of values based on the key.
* set: A collection of unique elements, similar to a sorted array, which allows for fast membership testing and iteration over the elements in sorted order.

Container adapters
------------------

* stack: A container that only allows adding elements to one end (the top) and removing them from the other end (the top). It is useful for implementing data structures such as 
function call stacks or undo operations.
* queue: A container that adds elements to one end (the back) and removes them from the other end (the front). It is useful for implementing data structures such as message queues or 
printing jobs in a print spooler.

Application of Container classes: vector, list
---------------------------------------------
### vector:
* Store large collections of elements that need fast access to any element.
* Useful for implementing data structures such as arrays, lists, and dynamic arrays.
* Support efficient searching using algorithms such as linear search or binary search.

### list:
* Ideal for storing collections where the order of elements is important but adding, removing, or reordering elements frequently is necessary.
* Useful for implementing data structures such as linked lists, graphs, and doubly-linked lists.

Algorithms - basic searching and sorting algorithms, min-max algorithm, set operations, heap sort
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Basic searching and sorting algorithms:
* Linear search: Iterate through an array or container, comparing each element to the target value until a match is found.
* Binary search: A more efficient method of searching that halves the number of elements to be searched at each step by using a divide-and-conquer approach.

### Min-max algorithm:
* Finds the minimum and maximum values in an array or container in a single pass.

### Set operations:
* Union, intersection, and difference: Combine, overlap, and exclude sets based on their elements.
* Symmetric difference: Compare two sets and return the elements that are unique to one or both sets.

### Heap sort:
* A comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a heap (a complete binary tree) with the largest value at the root, then iteratively swaps the root element with the last element in 
the heap and rebuilds the heap until the entire array is sorted.

Iterators - input, output, forward, bidirectional and random access
-----------------------------------------------------------------
### Iterator:
* A generic pointer that allows traversing through a container or data structure without knowing its underlying implementation details.

### Input iterator:
* Allows reading from an iterator but does not allow writing to it.

### Output iterator:
* Allows writing to an iterator but does not allow reading from it.

### Forward iterator:
* Supports both input and output iterators, allowing reading and writing within a single range of elements.

### Bidirectional iterator:
* In addition to the capabilities of forward iterators, bidirectional iterators can traverse in both directions (forwards and backwards).

### Random access iterator:
* Supports all the operations of bidirectional iterators, as well as random access to any element within a container.

Object Oriented Programming – a roadmap to future
-------------------------------------------------

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on designing software using objects and their interactions. Here's a roadmap for understanding and mastering 
OOP:

1. Understand the four fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
2. Learn how to create classes, define constructors, and use member functions, variables, and methods.
3. Practice implementing encapsulation by using access specifiers (public, private, protected) to control the visibility of class members.
4. Master inheritance by creating subclasses that inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes.
5. Implement polymorphism using virtual functions, operator overloading, and templates.
6. Understand abstract classes, interfaces, and multiple inheritance.
7. Learn design patterns and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
8. Master exception handling by creating custom exceptions and using try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.
9. Become proficient in creating reusable code by using the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
10. Master advanced topics such as multiple inheritance, operator overloading, templates, and metaprogramming.

By following this roadmap, you'll be well on your way to becoming an expert in object-oriented programming!
