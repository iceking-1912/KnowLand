- Algorithms:
    - Problem Solving: Techniques for Approaching Computational Problems
    - Design Tools: Pseudocode and Flowcharts for Algorithm Representation
    - Complexity Analysis: Space and Time Complexity Measurement
- Algorithmic Strategies: Divide and Conquer, Greedy Approach
- **Exemplar/Case Studies:**
    - Multiplication Techniques: Analyze the efficiency of multiplication algorithms like Gauss multiplication and Karatsuba algorithm.
    - Social Network Analysis: How graphs (a type of non-linear data structure) are used to model relationships and analyze information flow in social networks.
- **Course Outcomes (CO):**
    - CO1: Apply problem-solving techniques to design algorithms.

- **Course Outcomes (CO):**
    - CO2: Implement fundamental data structures using arrays.
    - CO3: Analyze the complexity of operations on linear data structures.

**[[Unit III- Searching and Sorting]]**

- Searching Techniques: Linear Search (Variants), Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms: Internal vs. External Sorting Methods
- Sorting Concepts: Order, Stability, Efficiency, Number of Passes
- Comparison-Based Sorting: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort
- Non-Comparison Sorting: Radix Sort, Counting Sort, Bucket Sort
- Sorting Analysis: Comparing Complexity of Different Sorting Algorithms
- **Exemplar/Case Studies:**
    - Search Algorithms in Bioinformatics: Binary search is used to efficiently search for specific DNA sequences in large genomes.
    - Sorting E-commerce Products: Sorting algorithms are used to arrange products based on price, popularity, or other criteria on e-commerce websites.
- **Course Outcomes (CO):**
    - CO1: Apply appropriate searching and sorting techniques to solve problems.
    - CO4: Evaluate the efficiency of different searching and sorting algorithms.

**Unit IV: Linked List**
