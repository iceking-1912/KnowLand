### **Unit VI: Introduction to Computer Architecture (07 Hours)**

In this unit, the focus is on understanding the architecture and operation of a microprocessor, which is central to most modern computing systems. A **microprocessor-based system** consists of a microprocessor, memory, and input/output (I/O) devices, with communication between these components facilitated by three main buses: the **Data Bus**, the **Address Bus**, and the **Control Bus**.

- **Data Bus**: This bidirectional bus transfers data between the microprocessor and other components (like memory or I/O devices).
- **Address Bus**: This unidirectional bus carries the memory address from the microprocessor to memory or I/O devices.
- **Control Bus**: This bus carries control signals that direct the operation of the system, such as **read/write** commands, clock signals, and interrupt signals.

The **microprocessor** itself contains various components:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: It performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Registers**: Temporary storage locations for data that the microprocessor is currently processing.
- **Control Unit**: Directs the operation of the microprocessor by sending control signals to other components.
- **Clock**: Provides synchronization for the entire system.

The microprocessor operates in three basic stages: **fetching** an instruction from memory, **decoding** the instruction to understand what action is needed, and **executing** the instruction by performing the necessary operations.

One key functional unit in microprocessors is the **ALU**. For example, the **74181 ALU** is a 4-bit ALU that performs various arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logical (AND, OR, XOR) operations. The microprocessor can use this ALU for both simple operations like addition and more complex tasks such as multiplying two numbers using the ALU and **shift registers**. The shift registers temporarily hold values and shift the bits during operations, ensuring that the intermediate partial products in multiplication are correctly aligned.

In terms of **memory organization**, the microprocessor uses **decoders** to select memory addresses and **registers** to temporarily store data being read from or written to memory. A **decoder** translates an address from the microprocessor into a specific memory location, and **registers** store data being processed.

Overall, this unit emphasizes the integration of the microprocessor's components and the role of buses, ALUs, shift registers, and memory in performing operations. The use of these components allows the microprocessor to execute complex tasks efficiently, making it the central component of modern digital systems.
