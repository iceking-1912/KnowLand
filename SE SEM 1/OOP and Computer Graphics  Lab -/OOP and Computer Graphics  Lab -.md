        - Overload `operator+` to add two complex numbers.
        - Overload `operator*` to multiply two complex numbers.
        - Overload `operator<<` and `operator>>` to print and read Complex Numbers.

        - Instantiates `Book` and `Tape` classes
        - Allows user input for data
        - Displays data members
        - Replaces all values with zero if an exception is caught.
- [ ] Done

### **Group B**

#### **4. File Operations:**

- _Write C++ code for the following:_

    - **b)** Write information to the file.
    - **c)** Close the file.
    - **d)** Open it again as an input file.
    - **e)** Read the information from the file.
- [ ] Done

#### **5. Function Template for Selection Sort:**

- _Write C++ code for the following:_
    -  _Write a function template for selection sort that:_
        - Inputs, sorts, and outputs an integer array.
        - Inputs, sorts, and outputs a float array.
- [ ] Done

### **Group C**

#### **6. Sorting and Searching using STL:**

- **Option 1:** _Write C++ code for the following:_
    - Use STL for sorting and searching user-defined records such as personal records (Name, DOB, Telephone number, etc.) using the `vector` container.
- **Option 2:** _Write C++ code for the following:_
    - Use STL for sorting and searching user-defined records such as Item records (Item code, name, cost, quantity, etc.) using the `vector` container.
- [ ] Done

#### **7. Map Associative Container:**

- _Write C++ code for the following:_
    - **a)** Use the `map` associative container.
    - **b)** The keys will be the names of states and the values will be the populations of the states.
    - **c)** When the program runs, prompt the user to type the name of a state. The program should then look in the map, using the state name as an index, and return the population of the state.
 - [ ] Done
